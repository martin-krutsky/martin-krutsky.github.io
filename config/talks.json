      "title": "Assessing Explainability for AI Safety Governance",
      "date": "May 27, 2025",
      "venue": "International Conference on Large-Scale AI Risks, KU Leuven, Belgium",
      "description": "Presented our work on a safety- and governance-informed assessment framework of AI explainability techniques. The proposal, combining AI safety and AI regulation desiderata, was well-received by the interdisciplinary audience of computer scientists, philosophers, lawyers, and policy makers. We proposed a 5-dimensional framework for assessing XAI methods: understandability to subjects and auditors, veracity, actionability, and scalability.",
