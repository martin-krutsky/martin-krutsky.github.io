      "title": "\"Cause\" is Mechanistic Narrative within Scientific Domains: An Ordinary Language Philosophical Critique of \"Causal Machine Learning\"",
      "authors": "V. Kungurtsev, L. C. Moore, G. Šír, M. Krutský",
      "venue": "arXiv preprint",
      "year": "2025",
      "type": "Preprint",
      "description": "A philosophical critique of causal machine learning that applies Ordinary Language methodology to investigate the semantics of cause and effect reasoning. The work examines how causality manifests differently across scientific domains (physics/engineering, biology, social sciences) and argues that definitive causal claims require evidence aggregation across multiple domains, highlighting methodological challenges in harmonizing language games and emergence across scales.",

      "description": "A contribution to the Geometric Deep Learning framework by studying symmetries in planning problems and implementing symmetry-invariant graph neural network for the Rubik's cube problem. The presented architecture outperforms previous state-of-the-art solutions in cost-to-goal regression experiments and exhibits high interpretability, with explanations based on intrinsic properties being preferable to standard explainer algorithms.",

      "description": "A comprehensive exploration of neural architectures that explicitly exploit domain symmetries, including weight-sharing schemes, convolutions, Deep Sets, and graph neural networks. The work demonstrates that symmetry-aware architectures outperform conventional models on problems exhibiting various symmetries, from simple functions like XOR to complex tasks like combinatorial problems.",
