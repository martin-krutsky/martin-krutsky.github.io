## ⚙️ Modular Configuration System

The website now uses a **modular configuration approach**! Each section has its own configuration file, making it incredibly easy to manage and update specific content without affecting other sections.

### Configuration Files:

1. **`config/site.json`** - Site settings, personal information, and navigation
2. **`config/research.json`** - Research areas and descriptions
3. **`config/papers.json`** - Publications and academic papers
4. **`config/talks.json`** - Talks and presentations
5. **`config/social.json`** - Social media links

### Benefits of Modular Configuration:

✅ **Focused Editing**: Edit only the section you need to update  
✅ **Better Organization**: Each file has a specific purpose  
✅ **Easier Maintenance**: Smaller, focused files are easier to manage  
✅ **Version Control**: Track changes to specific sections separately  
✅ **Collaboration**: Multiple people can edit different sections simultaneously

## 🔄 Migration from Single Config File

If you're migrating from the previous single `config.json` approach:

1. **Backup your current content** from the single config file
2. **Distribute the content** into the appropriate modular files:
   - Site settings → `config/site.json`
   - Research areas → `config/research.json`
   - Publications → `config/papers.json`
   - Talks → `config/talks.json`
   - Social links → `config/social.json`
3. **Test the website** to ensure everything loads correctly

The modular system makes future updates much more organized and maintainable!
